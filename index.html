			I'm a man of many interests who enjoys simplicity of life but complexity of things and ideas.<br/>
			From a love of creation, I enjoy cooking, creative writing, and of course, software engineering. <br/>
			As a great friend of abstraction, I enjoy dabbling in complex ideas, and pushing myself to continuously learn on my journey to become a master.

				As with many, videogames was my gateway into coding, so naturally, a lot of my earlier coding projects are game related.
				I made this tool to help me draw blocky 2d retro pixelated style art and quickly export it as a transparent PNG to use in game dev.
